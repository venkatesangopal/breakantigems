       <h3>Basic Software Programs Every Windows User Must Have</h3>
 
    As we all know, Windows is one of the most widely used operating systems. So today, We are presenting to you an exclusive list of basic programs for Windows users.

    Let’s assume you just bought a new system or formatted your computer and if you don’t have any idea which software programs you should install on your computer, then this post is going to be a boon for you. Don’t worry, leave the job to me. I collected a huge list of programs which are sufficient for 95% of Windows users. It took me several hours to collect them and present them to you. Hope you like it and let me know in the comments if you have any suggestions.
    <h3>25 Useful Software Programs  for Windows Users:</h3>
    <h3>1.Good Antivirus:-</h3>
    <p>A good antivirus software is a must for PCs to safeguard them from harmful threats, trojans, malware, spyware etc.Below I listed some of the best antivirus  programs.</p>
    <h3>2.Vlc Media Player</h3>
      <p>Listening to songs and watching movies is one of the most important thing we do in our PC. So we need a good media player which can play almost all formats of audio and video files.<p>
    <h3>3. Registry Cleaners/Tune up Utilities:-</h3>
    <p>You need an all-in-one software which cleans registry errors and junk files from your PC and makes your PC run smooth and fast. For this I would recommend Tuneup Utilities, Uniblue Power Suite or Ccleaner.
    I suggest you get one of those three programs and run them when you start using your PC. I guarantee you that your PC will run like a dream using these utilities.</p>
    <h3>4. Image Burner(Nero):-</h3>
      <p>Nero is the best software if you want to burn any type of CD or DVD, but Nero is not free so I recommend Img Burner which is very much similar to Nero but you can get it for free.</p>
    <h3>5. Firefox and Google Chrome:-</h3>
    <p>These are the two leading browsers right now that I recommend you get.
      Mozilla Firefox is the best browser ever made for its multi-functional use. Google Chrome is the fastest and safest browser. It’s a good idea to have at least 2 browsers installed, in case something doesn’t work or display right with one browser, you can test it using the other one.</p>
    <h3>6. MS Office / Open Office:-</h3>
    <p>We can’t imagine a business without MS Office. Right from student to a business man, it’s a must have software, but it’s not for free so I recommend you use Open Office which is very much similar to MS office with the added bonus that it is free.</p>
    <h3>7. Adobe Reader:-</h3>
    <p>If you want to read ebooks and pdf documents then its a must software for you.</p>
    <h3>8. 7 Zip:-</h3>
      <p>Open source Windows utility for manipulating archives. Formats 7z, ZIP, GZIP, BZIP2 and TAR are supported fully, other formats can be unpacked. It has the highest compression ratio ever.</p>
      <h3>9. Internet Download Manager:-</h3>
      <p>IDM is a must have software for PC as it increases our overall download speed by 5 times.</p>
    <h3>10. Utorrent:-</h3>
    <p>Utorrent is a light weight and very efficient torrent client.</p>
    <h3>11.Adobe Photoshop/GIMP:-</h3>
    <p>Adobe Photoshop is a great software for editing photos and 3d image creation.It can also be sued to make gifs for whoever is interested.</p>
    <h3>12. Revo Uninstaller:-</h3>
    <p>Revo Uninstaller is a freeware innovative uninstall utility much faster than Windows Add/Remove applet. With its advanced and fast algorithm, Revo Uninstaller performs a scan before and after you uninstall an application.
    </p>
    <h3>13. Adobe Flash Player:-</h3>
    <p>This is a must software if you want to watch flash videos on your computer.</p>
